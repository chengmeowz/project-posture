Project Posture is a project based on Python language development. Its purpose is to investigate for linear and/or non-linear relationships between various posturography (i.e., standing balance) and self-reported physical activity metrics. The project is under development.

The data for this project is from 
* [Santos, D. & Duarte, M. (2016). A public data set of human balance evaluations. PeerJ, 4, e2648. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2648.](https://peerj.com/articles/2648/).

The calculation for variables is based on 
* [Duarte M, Freitas SM. Revision of posturography based on force plate for balance evaluation. Rev Bras Fisioter. 2010;14(3):183-192.](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbfis/v14n3/en_03.pdf)
